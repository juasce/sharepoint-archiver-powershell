# POC Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the SharePoint Archiver PowerShell POC (Proof of Concept). The POC will validate core functionality before building the full production solution.

## POC Objectives

1. **Validate Authentication**: Ensure SharePoint and Azure Storage authentication works
2. **Test File Transfer**: Confirm AzCopy integration for single file transfers
3. **Verify Folder Discovery**: Enumerate SharePoint folder structures
4. **Demonstrate Scalability**: Handle multiple files and nested folders
5. **Establish Error Handling**: Basic logging and error reporting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Authentication and Connection

**Objective**: Establish secure connection to SharePoint using existing Key Vault secrets.

**Components to Build**:
- `SharePointAuth.psm1`: Authentication module
- Basic connection test script
- Key Vault integration

**Success Criteria**:
- Successfully authenticate to SharePoint using certificate
- Retrieve and validate SharePoint site access
- Connect to Azure Storage using managed identity

**Key Functions**:
```powershell
# SharePointAuth.psm1
Connect-SharePointOnline
Get-AzureStorageContext
Test-SharePointConnection
```

**Testing Approach**:
- Test with a simple SharePoint site
- Verify access to a known storage account
- Validate certificate retrieval from Key Vault

### Phase 2: Single File Transfer

**Objective**: Transfer a single file from SharePoint to Azure Storage using AzCopy.

**Components to Build**:
- `AzCopyManager.psm1`: AzCopy wrapper module
- File transfer orchestration
- Progress reporting

**Success Criteria**:
- Download single file from SharePoint
- Upload file to Azure Storage maintaining original name
- Report transfer progress and completion status

**Key Functions**:
```powershell
# AzCopyManager.psm1
Invoke-AzCopyTransfer
Get-TransferProgress
Test-AzCopyAvailability
```

**Testing Approach**:
- Test with small file (< 1MB)
- Test with medium file (10-50MB)
- Verify file integrity after transfer

### Phase 3: Folder Discovery and Enumeration

**Objective**: Recursively discover all files and folders in SharePoint hierarchy.

**Components to Build**:
- `SharePointDiscovery.psm1`: Content enumeration module
- Folder structure mapping
- File metadata collection

**Success Criteria**:
- Enumerate all files in a SharePoint library
- Handle nested folder structures (3+ levels deep)
- Generate complete file manifest with paths

**Key Functions**:
```powershell
# SharePointDiscovery.psm1
Get-SharePointFolderContents
Get-SharePointFileMetadata
Build-FileManifest
```

**Testing Approach**:
- Test with simple folder (2-3 files)
- Test with nested folders (2-3 levels)
- Test with mixed content (files and folders at same level)

### Phase 4: Bulk Transfer with Progress Reporting

**Objective**: Transfer multiple files while maintaining folder structure and providing progress updates.

**Components to Build**:
- `Logger.psm1`: Structured logging module
- Bulk transfer orchestration
- Progress tracking and reporting

**Success Criteria**:
- Transfer multiple files preserving folder structure
- Provide real-time progress updates
- Handle partial failures gracefully

**Key Functions**:
```powershell
# Logger.psm1
Write-ProgressLog
Write-ErrorLog
Write-TransferSummary

# Main Script
Invoke-BulkTransfer
```

**Testing Approach**:
- Test with 5-10 files in 2-3 folders
- Test with mixed file sizes
- Verify folder structure preservation

### Phase 5: Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Objective**: Implement robust error handling with retry mechanisms.

**Components to Build**:
- Retry logic for failed transfers
- Comprehensive error logging
- Recovery mechanisms

**Success Criteria**:
- Gracefully handle network interruptions
- Retry failed transfers automatically
- Generate detailed error reports

**Key Functions**:
```powershell
Invoke-TransferWithRetry
Handle-TransferError
Generate-ErrorReport
```

**Testing Approach**:
- Simulate network failures
- Test with invalid URLs
- Verify retry behavior

### Phase 6: Pipeline Integration

**Objective**: Integrate POC with Azure DevOps pipeline for automated execution.

**Components to Build**:
- `azure-pipelines-powershell.yml`: Pipeline definition
- Parameter handling
- Pipeline logging integration

**Success Criteria**:
- Execute successfully in Azure DevOps
- Accept pipeline parameters correctly
- Provide clear execution logs

**Pipeline Structure**:
```yaml
parameters:
- name: sharepointUrl
- name: storageAccountName
- name: containerName

steps:
- task: PowerShell@2
  displayName: 'Archive SharePoint Content'
```

## POC Testing Strategy

### Test Data Requirements

**Small Scale Test**:
- SharePoint library with 3-5 files
- 2 folders with 1-2 files each
- File sizes: 1MB, 10MB, 100MB

**Medium Scale Test**:
- SharePoint library with 15-20 files
- 5 folders with nested subfolders
- Mixed file sizes including 1GB+ files

**Large Scale Validation**:
- Subset of production scenario
- 10 folders with 50+ files
- Include one 5GB+ file for performance testing

### Performance Benchmarks

**Transfer Speed Targets**:
- Small files (< 10MB): 100+ files per minute
- Medium files (10MB-1GB): Network bandwidth limited
- Large files (> 1GB): Resume capability essential

**Resource Usage Limits**:
- Memory usage: < 1GB for any single operation
- CPU usage: < 50% sustained during transfers
- Network: Efficiently use available bandwidth

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1**: Phases 1-2 (Authentication and single file transfer)
**Week 2**: Phases 3-4 (Folder discovery and bulk transfer)
**Week 3**: Phases 5-6 (Error handling and pipeline integration)
**Week 4**: Testing, refinement, and documentation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- [ ] Authenticate successfully to SharePoint and Azure Storage
- [ ] Transfer single file maintaining integrity
- [ ] Enumerate complex folder structures (50+ folders)
- [ ] Transfer bulk content preserving folder hierarchy
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully with detailed reporting
- [ ] Execute via Azure DevOps pipeline

### Performance Success
- [ ] Handle 50GB+ files without memory issues
- [ ] Process 50+ folder structures in reasonable time
- [ ] Provide real-time progress updates
- [ ] Resume interrupted transfers

### Operational Success
- [ ] Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Easy parameter configuration
- [ ] Pipeline integration with minimal setup

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Authentication Failures**: Have fallback certificate-based auth ready
- **AzCopy Issues**: Test thoroughly in target environment
- **SharePoint Throttling**: Implement proper retry delays
- **Large File Timeouts**: Configure appropriate timeout values

### Operational Risks
- **Pipeline Agent Issues**: Test on actual self-hosted agent
- **Network Limitations**: Plan for bandwidth constraints
- **Permission Issues**: Validate all required permissions upfront

## Next Steps After POC

### Production Readiness
1. **Security Review**: Full security assessment of authentication flow
2. **Performance Optimization**: Tune for production workloads
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. **Documentation**: Complete operational procedures

### Extended Features
1. **Incremental Archiving**: Only transfer changed files
2. **Notification System**: Email/Teams notifications for completion
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Include/exclude patterns for files
4. **Multi-tenant Support**: Handle multiple SharePoint tenants

This POC implementation guide provides a structured approach to validating the core concepts while building toward a production-ready solution.
